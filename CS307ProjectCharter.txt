Project Statement: 
Currently, there are skilled individuals who, while proficient in their area of expertise, require the help of someone with a different specialization. The problem comes in when trying to find someone who fits the bill. Our app will attempt to connect people with different skillsets so that they might work together to complete more complex projects.


Project Objectives:
1. Create a profile depicting what kind of skills you have, what you are looking for, etc.
2. Create an algorithm to match people’s skills with skills people are looking for
3. Store user profile information across all devices
4. Intuitive and simple user interface
5. Allows users that match to message one another
6. Allow ratings to determine if people actually possess the skills they say they do
7. Possible location feature to match to people nearby
